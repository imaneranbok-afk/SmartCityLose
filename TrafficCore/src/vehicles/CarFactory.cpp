// CarFactory removed. This file is now obsolete and can be deleted.
// All factory functionality is available through VehiculeFactory.h / VehiculeFactory.cpp.
// For backward compatibility, any includes of CarFactory.h will fail at compile time
// with a clear message directing to VehiculeFactory.h (see include/Vehicules/CarFactory.h).
